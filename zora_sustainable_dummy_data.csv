oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:1;HEE-GER: a systematic review of German economic evaluations of health care published 1990-2004;2007;Schwappach, D L B, Boluarte, T A;BioMed Central;https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/1/;"BACKGROUND: Studies published in non-English languages are systematically missing in systematic reviews of growth and quality of economic evaluations of health care. The aims of this study were: to characterize German evaluations, published in English or German-language, in terms of various key parameters; to investigate methods to derive quality-of-life weights in cost-utility studies; and to examine changes in study characteristics over the years. METHODS: We conducted a country-specific systematic review of the German and English-language literature of German economic evaluations (assessment of or application to the German health care system) published 1990-2004. Generic and specialized health economic databases were searched. Two independent reviewers verified fulfillment of inclusion criteria and extracted study characteristics. RESULTS: The fulltexts of 730 articles were reviewed of which 283 fulfilled all entry criteria. 32% of included studies were published in German-language. 51% of studies evaluated pharmaceuticals and 63% were cost-effectiveness analyses. Economic appraisals concentrate on few disease categories and important health areas are strongly underrepresented. Declaration of sponsorship was associated with article language (49% English articles vs. 29% German articles, p < 0.001). The methodology used to obtain quality-of-life weights in published cost-utility studies was very diverse, poorly reported and most studies did not use German patients' or community health state evaluations. CONCLUSION: Many of the German-language evaluations included in our study are likely to be missing in international reviews and may be systematically different from English-language reviews from Germany. Lack of transparency and adherence to recommended reporting practices constitute a serious problem in German economic evaluations.";Faculty of Medicine: Swiss Research Institute for Public Health and Addiction;Faculty of Medicine;Swiss Research Institute for Public Health and Addiction;;1;7375626A656374733D3130313730;3130303735;;0,01282832;0,007723357;0,774657488;0,643416405;0,004785812;0,002517599;0,002244581;0,770318925;0,682399631;0,99359411;0,061038926;0,688274026;0,004396426;0,002261037;0,006230518;0,517584562;0,965642869;en;Germany;Germany
oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:2;The economics of primary prevention of cardiovascular disease - a systematic review of economic evaluations;2007;Schwappach, D L B, Boluarte, T A, Suhrcke, M;BioMed Central;https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/2/;"BACKGROUND: In the quest for public and private resources, prevention continues to face a difficult challenge in obtaining tangible public and political support. This may be partly because the economic evidence in favour of prevention is often said to be largely missing. The overall aim of this paper is to examine whether economic evidence in favour of prevention does exist, and if so, what its main characteristics, weaknesses and strengths are. We concentrate on the evidence regarding primary prevention that targets cardiovascular disease event or risk reduction. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review of journal articles published during the period 1995-2005, based on a comprehensive key-word based search in generic and specialized electronic databases, accompanied by manual searches of expert databases. The search strategy consisted of combinations of freetext and keywords related to economic evaluation, cardiovascular diseases, and primary preventive interventions of risk assessment or modification. RESULTS: A total of 195 studies fulfilled all of the relevant inclusion criteria. Overall, a significant amount of relevant economic evidence in favour of prevention does exist, despite important remaining gaps. The majority of studies were cost-effectiveness-analyses, expressing benefits as ""life years gained"", were conducted in a US or UK setting, assessed clinical prevention, mainly drugs targeted at lowering lipid levels, and referred to subjects aged 35-64 years old with at least one risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: First, this review has demonstrated the obvious lack of economic evaluations of broader health promotion interventions, when compared to clinical prevention. Second, the clear role for government to engage more actively in the economic evaluation of prevention has become very obvious, namely, to fill the gap left by private industry in terms of the evaluation of broader public health interventions and regarding clinical prevention, in light of the documented relationship between study funding and reporting of favourable results. Third, the value of greater adherence to established guidelines on economic evaluation cannot be emphasised enough. Finally, there appear to be certain methodological features in the practice of health economic evaluations that might bias the choice between prevention and cure in favour of the latter.";Faculty of Medicine: Swiss Research Institute for Public Health and Addiction;Faculty of Medicine;Swiss Research Institute for Public Health and Addiction;;2;7375626A656374733D3130313730;3130303735;;0,007543785;0,005999904;0,975836098;0,020992294;0,00298428;0,002393521;0,002323867;0,028416479;0,9294734;0,994378388;0,050061226;0,431033701;0,004498663;0,002349649;0,005145932;0,21438463;0,979304969;en;US UK;United Kingdom, United States
oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:6;First isolation and further characterization of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) O157:H45 strains from cattle;2004;Stephan, Roger, Borel, Nicole, Zweifel, Claudio, Blanco, M A, Blanco, J E;BioMed Central;https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/6/;BACKGROUND: Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), mainly causing infantile diarrhoea, represents one of at least six different categories of diarrheagenic E. coli with corresponding distinct pathogenic schemes. The mechanism of EPEC pathogenesis is based on the ability to introduce the attaching-and-effacing (A/E) lesions and intimate adherence of bacteria to the intestinal epithelium. The role and the epidemiology of non-traditional enteropathogenic E. coli serogroup strains are not well established. E. coli O157:H45 EPEC strains, however, are described in association with enterocolitis and sporadic diarrhea in human. Moreover, a large outbreak associated with E. coli O157:H45 EPEC was reported in Japan in 1998. During a previous study on the prevalence of E. coli O157 in healthy cattle in Switzerland, E. coli O157:H45 strains originating from 6 fattening cattle and 5 cows were isolated. In this study, phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of these strains are described. Various virulence factors (stx, eae, ehxA, astA, EAF plasmid, bfp) of different categories of pathogenic E. coli were screened by different PCR systems. Moreover, the capability of the strains to adhere to cells was tested on tissue culture cells. RESULTS: All 11 sorbitol-positive E. coli O157:H45 strains tested negative for the Shiga toxin genes (stx), but were positive for eae and were therefore considered as EPEC. All strains harbored eae subtype alpha1. The gene encoding the heat-stable enterotoxin 1 (EAST1) was found in 10 of the 11 strains. None of the strains, however, carried ehx A genes. The capability of the strains to adhere to cells was shown by 10 strains harbouring bfp gene by localized adherence pattern on HEp-2 and Caco-2 cells. CONCLUSION: This study reports the first isolation of typical O157:H45 EPEC strains from cattle. Furthermore, our findings emphasize the fact that E. coli with the O157 antigen are not always STEC but may belong to other pathotypes. Cattle seem also to be a reservoir of O157:H45 EPEC strains, which are described in association with human diseases. Therefore, these strains appear to play a role as food borne pathogens and have to be considered and evaluated in view of food safety aspects.;Vetsuisse Faculty: Institute of Veterinary Pathology;Vetsuisse Faculty;Institute of Veterinary Pathology;;6;7375626A656374733D3130323531;3130313834;;0,003985698;0,786222279;0,998468459;0,00161313;0,028587313;0,042333335;0,648415148;0,006955781;0,066958271;0,03363071;0,022359662;0,780150235;0,005080748;0,986236155;0,480941236;0,002944766;0,009716646;en;Japan Switzerland;Switzerland, Japan
oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:7;Risk factors for antibiotic resistance in Campylobacter spp. isolated from raw poultry meat in Switzerland;2003;Ledergerber, U, Regula, G, Stephan, Roger, Danuser, J, Bissig, B, Stärk, K D C;BioMed Central;https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/7/;"BACKGROUND: The world-wide increase of foodborne infections with antibiotic resistant pathogens is of growing concern and is designated by the World Health Organization as an emerging public health problem. Thermophilic Campylobacter have been recognised as a major cause of foodborne bacterial gastrointestinal human infections in Switzerland and in many other countries throughout the world. Poultry meat is the most common source for foodborne cases caused by Campylobacter. Because all classes of antibiotics recommended for treatment of human campylobacteriosis are also used in veterinary medicine, in view of food safety, the resistance status of Campylobacter isolated from poultry meat is of special interest. METHODS: Raw poultry meat samples were collected throughout Switzerland and Liechtenstein at retail level and examined for Campylobacter spp. One strain from each Campylobacter-positive sample was selected for susceptibility testing with the disc diffusion and the E-test method. Risk factors associated with resistance to the tested antibiotics were analysed by multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: In total, 91 Campylobacter spp. strains were isolated from 415 raw poultry meat samples. Fifty-one strains (59%) were sensitive to all tested antibiotics. Nineteen strains (22%) were resistant to a single, nine strains to two antibiotics, and eight strains showed at least three antibiotic resistances. Resistance was observed most frequently to ciprofloxacin (28.7%), tetracycline (12.6%), sulphonamide (11.8%), and ampicillin (10.3%). One multiple resistant strain exhibited resistance to five antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and erythromycin. These are the most important antibiotics for treatment of human campylobacteriosis. A significant risk factor associated with multiple resistance in Campylobacter was foreign meat production compared to Swiss meat production (odds ratio = 5.7). CONCLUSION: Compared to the situation in other countries, the data of this study show a favourable resistance situation for Campylobacter strains isolated from raw poultry meat produced in Switzerland. Nevertheless, the prevalence of 19% ciprofloxacin resistant strains is of concern and has to be monitored. ""Foreign production vs. Swiss production"" was a significant risk factor for multiple resistance in the logistic regression model. Therefore, an adequate resistance-monitoring programme should include meat produced in Switzerland as well as imported meat samples.";Vetsuisse Faculty: Institute of Food Safety and Hygiene;Vetsuisse Faculty;Institute of Food Safety and Hygiene;;7;7375626A656374733D3130323531;3130303832;;0,004086536;0,945315957;0,743433595;0,001551944;0,002240226;0,069761269;0,002130777;0,008526063;0,664775074;0,021667393;0,035449881;0,814439535;0,005177603;0,019769002;0,013058224;0,002922045;0,692924738;en;Switzerland Switzerland Liechtenstein Switzerland;Switzerland, Lichtenstein
oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:8;Detection of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis specific IS900 insertion sequences in bulk-tank milk samples obtained from different regions throughout Switzerland;2002;Corti, S, Stephan, Roger;BioMed Central;https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/8/;BACKGROUND: Since Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) was isolated from intestinal tissue of a human patient suffering Crohn's disease, a controversial discussion exists whether MAP have a role in the etiology of Crohn's disease or not. Raw milk may be a potential vehicle for the transmission of MAP to human population. In a previous paper, we have demonstrated that MAP are found in raw milk samples obtained from a defined region in Switzerland. The aim of this work is to collect data about the prevalence of MAP specific IS900 insertion sequence in bulk-tank milk samples in different regions of Switzerland. Furthermore, we examined eventual correlation between the presence of MAP and the somatic cell counts, the total colony counts and the presence of Enterobacteriaceae. RESULTS: 273 (19.7%) of the 1384 examined bulk-tank milk samples tested IS900 PCR-positive. The prevalence, however, in the different regions of Switzerland shows significant differences and ranged from 1.7% to 49.2%. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant (p >> 0.05) differences between the somatic cell counts and the total colony counts of PCR-positive and PCR-negative milk samples. Enterobacteriaceae occur as often in IS900 PCR-positive as in PCR-negative milk samples. CONCLUSION: This is the first study, which investigates the prevalence of MAP in bulk-tank milk samples all over Switzerland and infers the herd-level prevalence of MAP infection in dairy herds. The prevalence of 19.7% IS900 PCR-positive bulk-milk samples shows a wide distribution of subclinical MAP-infections in dairy stock in Switzerland. MAP can therefore often be transmitted to humans by raw milk consumption.;Vetsuisse Faculty: Institute of Food Safety and Hygiene;Vetsuisse Faculty;Institute of Food Safety and Hygiene;;8;7375626A656374733D3130323531;3130303832;;0,00393602;0,897603691;0,705402076;0,001647399;0,003032787;0,033373039;0,001905754;0,013454963;0,013805054;0,071600854;0,056347426;0,825296879;0,00447165;0,077846162;0,235088065;0,002932502;0,018555814;en;Switzerland Switzerland Switzerland Switzerland Switzerland;Switzerland

To determine vaccination status awareness and the sociodemographic predictors of awareness for tetanus, hepatitis A and B, tick born encephalitis (TBE) and influenza vaccination. METHODS: Multivariate analyses were used to evaluate a questionnaire survey of 10,321 employees (4070 women and 6251 men aged 15-72 years) of two companies in Switzerland. RESULTS: Among 10,321 respondents, 75.5% reported knowing their tetanus vaccination status, 64.1% hepatitis A, 61.1% hepatitis B, 64.3% TBE and 71.9% influenza. Between 1 in 4 and 1 in 3 employees were not aware of their vaccination status. Differences in awareness for the five vaccinations considered correlated with gender and language. These differences persisted in multivariate analyses. CONCLUSION: Women employees, German-speaking employees and employees who paid more attention to their diet were more often aware of their vaccination status. A more reliable and readily accessible data source for vaccination status is needed in order to capitalize on opportunities to update vaccinations among Swiss employees.;Faculty of Medicine: Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute (EBPI);Faculty of Medicine;Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute (EBPI);;40;7375626A656374733D3130313730;3130303630;;0,319301426;0,784181595;0,998292267;0,692741394;0,91940248;0,005460377;0,00207521;0,90694654;0,623413086;0,07862635;0,017793478;0,004318471;0,00465983;0,00276487;0,006426869;0,158972517;0,28164801;en;Switzerland;Switzerland

(ECRHS-Basel and SAPALDIA);2006;Imboden, M, Nieters, A, Bircher, A J, Brutsche, M, Becker, N, Wjst, M, Ackermann-Liebrich, U, Berger, W, Probst-Hensch, N M, Sapaldia Team;BioMed Central;https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/41/;BACKGROUND: Atopy and allergic phenotypes are biologically characterized by an imbalanced T helper cell response skewed towards a type 2 (TH2) immune response associated with elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels. Polymorphisms in cytokine genes might modulate regulation of the TH1/TH2 balance. We thus aimed at reproducing our previous findings from a European study population on the association of various cytokine polymorphisms with self-reported hay fever as well as increased total and specific IgE levels in two comparable study populations. METHODS: Two prospective Caucasian cohorts were used. In the Basel center of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS, n = 418) ten distinct cytokine polymorphisms of putative functional relevance were genotyped. In the Swiss cohort Study on Air Pollution And Lung Disease In Adults (SAPALDIA, n = 6003) two cytokine polymorphisms were genotyped. The associations of these polymorphisms with atopy were estimated by covariance and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: We confirmed IL4, IL10, IL6 and IL18 as candidate genes for atopic health outcomes. In the large, well-characterized SAPALDIA cohort the IL6(-174G>C) and IL18(-137G>C) polymorphisms were associated with circulating total IgE concentrations in subjects with hay fever. The IL18(-137G>C) polymorphism was also associated with the prevalence of hay fever. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive characterization of genetic variation in extended cytokine candidate gene regions is now needed.

Peripheral venous blood was taken at 450 m (Zürich level) and at 4000 m, and levels of erythropoietin (EPO), VEGF, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the acute-phase proteins complement C3 (C3), alpha1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT), transferrin (Tf) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. Peripheral arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) was recorded. Chest radiography was performed before and immediately after the experiment. EPO increased during altitude exposure, correlating with SaO2, in both groups (r = -0.86, P < 0.001). Venous serum VEGF did not show any elevation despite a marked decrease in SaO2 in the HAPE-S subjects [mean (SD) HAPE-S: 69.6 (9.1)%; controls: 78.7 (5.2)%]. C3 and alpha1AT levels increased in HAPE-S during hypobaric hypoxia [from 0.94 (0.11) g/l to 1.07 (0.13) g/l, and from 1.16 (0.08) g/l to 1.49 (0.27) g/l, respectively; P < 0.05], but remained within the clinical reference ranges. No significant elevations of IL-6, Tf or CRP were observed in either group. The post-exposure chest radiography revealed no signs of oedema. We conclude that VEGF is not up-regulated in HAPE-S and thus does not seem to increase critically pulmonary vascular permeability during the 1st day at high altitude. Furthermore, our data provide evidence against a clinically relevant inflammation in the initial phase of exposure to hypoxia in HAPE-S, although C3 and alpha1AT are mildly induced.";Faculty of Medicine: University Hospital Zurich: Institute of Clinical Chemistry;Faculty of Medicine;University Hospital Zurich;;64;7375626A656374733D3130313730;3130313938;;0,003990307;0,486515611;0,97478503;0,001592884;0,001982925;0,326098293;0,002479707;0,005836856;0,008867452;0,015510689;0,046777818;0,154621542;0,0052885;0,119493991;0,031805843;0,002904007;0,009033515;en;Zürich;Switzerland

Despite the high prevalence of COPD in Germany, Switzerland and Austria there is no validated disease-specific instrument available. The objective of this study was to translate the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ), one of the most widely used respiratory HRQL questionnaires, into German, develop an interviewer- and self-administered version including both standardised and individualised dyspnoea questions, and validate these versions in two randomised studies. METHODS: We recruited three groups of patients with COPD in Switzerland, Germany and Austria. The 44 patients of the first group completed the CRQ during pilot testing to adapt the CRQ to German-speaking patients. We then recruited 80 patients participating in pulmonary rehabilitation programs to assess internal consistency reliability and cross-sectional validity of the CRQ. The third group consisted of 38 patients with stable COPD without an intervention to assess test-retest reliability. To compare the interviewer- and self-administered versions, we randomised patients in groups 2 and 3 to the interviewer- or self-administered CRQ. Patients completed both the standardised and individualised dyspnoea questions. RESULTS: For both administration formats and all domains, we found good internal consistency reliability (Crohnbach's alpha between 0.73 and 0.89). Cross-sectional validity tended to be better for the standardised compared to the individualised dyspnoea questions and cross-sectional validity was slightly better for the self-administered format. Test-retest reliability was good for both the interviewer-administered CRQ (intraclass correlation coefficients for different domains between 0.81 and 0.95) and the self-administered format (intraclass correlation coefficients between 0.78 and 0.86). Lower within-person variability was responsible for the higher test-retest reliability of the interviewer-administered format while between person variability was similar for both formats.

One of the major barriers is the high cost of investment in these systems. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol provides industrialized countries with an incentive to invest in emission reduction projects in developing countries to achieve a low-cost reduction in carbon dioxide emissions that also promotes sustainable development in the host country. Wind power projects could be of interest under the CDM because, when developed properly, they directly displace greenhouse gas emissions while contributing to sustainable rural development. RESULTS: Our estimates indicate that there is a vast theoretical potential of carbon dioxide mitigation by the use of wind energy in India. The annual Certified Emission Reduction (CER) potential of wind power projects in India could theoretically reach 86 million. Under more realistic assumptions about the diffusion of wind power projects based on past experience with government run programmes, annual CER volumes could reach 41 to 67 million by 2012 and 78 to 83 million by 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The projections based on the past diffusion trend indicate that in India, even with highly favorable assumptions, the dissemination of wind power projects is not likely to reach its maximum estimated potential within the next 15 years. CDM could help to achieve the maximum utilization potential more rapidly as compared to the current diffusion trend if supportive policies are introduced.;Faculty of Arts: Institute of Political Science;Faculty of Arts;Institute of Political Science;;103;7375626A656374733D3130313731;3130313133;;0,004042249;0,093516827;0,011868852;0,001955617;0,002245923;0,004293144;0,972026169;0,069204807;0,956131458;0,004108567;0,19419995;0,536648393;0,875318408;0,004137301;0,217674598;0,003088294;0,988694608;en;India India India India;India

We studied the foraging behavior of adult water pipits (Anthus sp. spinoletta) feeding nestlings in an Alpine habitat near Davos, Switzerland, with the following results: (1) searching effort decreases with increasing distance from the nest, (2) the amount of prey and the proportion of large items brought to the nest increases with increasing foraging distance, (3) water pipits do not forage according to habitat availability, but prefer vegetation types with the highest food density (mainly grass and herbs) and avoid those with the lowest, and (4) this selectivity is only expressed when the birds forage more than 50 m from the nest, i.e., usually outside the territory. Among the several potential interpretations of these results, the most parsimonious is that foraging decisions are based on profitability, i.e., on the net energy gain per time unit. Additionally, we found that food conditions translate into fitness: the number of fledglings per nest is related positively to the average prey biomass at the foraging place and negatively to the average distance between the foraging place and the nest. Maximum economic distances, which were predicted from this food-fitness relationship, agreed well with the actual foraging distances observed. This suggests a dose connection between foraging decisions and fitness. In addition to the theoretical issues, some conservation issues are also briefly discussed.;Faculty of Science: Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies;Faculty of Science;Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies;;223;7375626A656374733D3130313732;3130313237;;0,003946895;0,814447105;0,006598575;0,001552776;0,325499684;0,878583312;0,705035985;0,411799133;0,010277542;0,019212265;0,064175867;0,736677408;0,003532494;0,366435796;0,873533368;0,00296109;0,008742226;en;Davos Switzerland;Switzerland

Today, listed as endangered, it is crucial to gain an understanding of gene flow and levels of genetic variation between breeding colonies to protect this species effectively. We developed seven microsatellite primers to investigate gene flow and population structure among four colonies. Locus-specific allelic diversity ranges from five to 11 alleles and observed heterozygosity ranges from 0.50 to 0.88. These markers cross-amplify in eight penguin species over five genera.;Faculty of Science: Institute of Zoology (former);Faculty of Science;Institute of Zoology (former);;456;7375626A656374733D3130313732;3130313237616C74;;0,003867649;0,040620986;0,007976694;0,001637422;0,002170378;0,059265207;0,007411463;0,006218613;0,009163187;0,042075552;0,040946413;0,019211583;0,106244303;0,997290909;0,161930278;0,002990005;0,00913461;en;Peru Chile;Chile

In the last century, guppies, Poecilia reticulata, repeatedly invaded streams in Australia and elsewhere. Quantitative genetic studies of one Australian guppy population have demonstrated high additive genetic variation for autosomal and Y-linked morphological traits. The combination of colonization success, high heritability of morphological traits, and the possibility of multiple introductions to Australia raised the prediction that neutral genetic diversity is high in introduced populations of guppies. In this study we examine genetic diversity at nine microsatellite and one mitochondrial locus for seven Australian populations. We used mtDNA haplotypes from the natural range of guppies and from domesticated varieties to identify source populations. There were a minimum of two introductions, but there was no haplotype diversity within Australian populations, suggesting a founder effect. This was supported by microsatellite markers, as allelic diversity and heterozygosity were severely reduced compared to one wild source population, and evidence of recent bottlenecks was found. Between Australian populations little differentiation of microsatellite allele frequencies was detected, suggesting that population admixture has occurred historically, perhaps due to male-biased gene flow followed by bottlenecks. Thus success of invasion of Australia and high additive genetic variance in Australian guppies are not associated with high levels of diversity at molecular loci. This finding is consistent with the release of additive genetic variation by dominance and epistasis following inbreeding, and with disruptive and negative frequency-dependent selection on fitness traits.;Faculty of Science: Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies;Faculty of Science;Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies;;479;7375626A656374733D3130313732;3130313237;;0,003809451;0,650961041;0,008936738;0,001576834;0,748351693;0,024291344;0,002158419;0,006872579;0,008746293;0,113564722;0,035031337;0,691983163;0,004058659;0,822784066;0,956568778;0,002903533;0,009032841;en;Australia Australia Australia;Australia

(1) Rates of rejection of model cuckoo eggs were lower at two unparasitised populations which did not have resident cuckoos, than at a rarely parasitised population which had cuckoos nearby, and at a regularly parasitised population. (2) Reed warblers from an unparasitised population showed a slightly weaker response to taxidermic mounts of cuckoos and, unlike a parasitised population, did not differentiate between mounts of a cuckoo, sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus and jay Garrulus glandarius. Differences in exposure to real predators may explain the differences in responses to mounted predators between populations, as specific aggressive responses to predators are likely to have been learned. Although evidence from dispersal and population turnover data suggests that there is likely to be gene flow between reed warbler populations in Britain, the hypothesis that the population differences reflect genotypic differences could not be ruled out. An alternative explanation of phenotypic plasticity in defences could also explain the population differences. Phenotypic plasticity in defences would be favoured in environments where the risk of parasitism fluctuates, if those defences are costly to unparasitised reed warblers.;Faculty of Science: Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies;Faculty of Science;Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies;;480;7375626A656374733D3130313732;3130313237;;0,004000899;0,13452132;0,009558464;0,001552383;0,003538042;0,022388605;0,002113779;0,005643051;0,009288851;0,092475608;0,041204162;0,066301271;0,003829008;0,918304443;0,752074897;0,003079841;0,070566706;en;Britain;United Kingdom

As R. esculenta has to backcross constantly with R. lessonae in order to produce viable offspring, this coexistence is obligatory for R. esculenta. Since R. esculenta has a higher primary fitness than R. lessonae, a mechanism is required that prevents the hybrid from driving the parental species, and hence itself, to extinction. Here, we present an analytical model and a computer simulation that investigate whether assortative mating can operate as a such a control mechanism. Our results show that assortative mating is very effective in regulating coexistence in such a hybrid-host system. This is particularly true when choice is affected by the proportion of the two male types in the population. Furthermore, we could show that even if the species composition in a mixed hybrid-host population may be largely influenced by differences in life-history parameters, assortative mating still plays a very important role by stabilizing coexistence. Thus, mating behavior turns out to be more important for the populations dynamics of hybridogenetic waterfrog systems than previously assumed.;Faculty of Science: Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies;Faculty of Science;Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies;;495;7375626A656374733D3130313732;3130313237;;0,003688843;0,068168707;0,009460196;0,00271177;0,937648833;0,985059381;0,001928109;0,006047345;0,009003578;0,086989097;0,032974534;0,768716156;0,003760264;0,307503432;0,56224221;0,002965597;0,009204093;en;Europe;Europe

Because of the animals' impact on agriculture, livestock and biodiversity, and the resulting necessity of realistic management practices, we were interested in the key environmental factors responsible for this remarkable development. The study was based on data from the canton Thurgau, a region in north-eastern Switzerland. We used data on damage and hunting success to calculate a population density index and related it to eight variables describing ecological conditions, demography and hunting pressure (measured by the number of hunters) over a 25-year period. The analysis shows that the population increase correlates with higher than average winter and spring temperatures and improved food supply through more mast years and an increase in the area of maize cultivation. While favourable temperature conditions mainly reduce juvenile mortality, enhanced food availability is likely to boost reproductive success through younger age at first reproduction, larger litter size and earlier onset of oestrus within a season. Given this link between food and reproduction, supplemental feeding, a management practice recommended and very common all over Europe, should be reconsidered.;Faculty of Science: Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies;Faculty of Science;Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies;;500;7375626A656374733D3130313732;3130313237;;0,004059829;0,983822048;0,552494526;0,001717563;0,524299085;0,019872265;0,002011928;0,011167379;0,009357774;0,035641108;0,223319769;0,537711978;0,004684959;0,822811604;0,921947062;0,003020833;0,013124445;en;Europe Thurgau Switzerland Europe;Switzerland

4. The probability of natal dispersal was not related either to the body condition or the body mass of the juvenile. Similarly, neither clutch size nor hatching date explained a significant proportion of the variance in the probability of dispersal.

5. The probability of male natal dispersal was related to the rank of the fledgling in the size-hierarchy within the brood. Low ranking individuals that hatched early in the season were more likely to disperse.

6. In both sexes, the survival of dispersers at the island of establishment was higher than among the residents on that island. Similarly, dispersers survived better than adults that remained on their island of birth.

Previous orientation experiments in Emlen funnels have been carried out either with hand-raised birds or with birds caught during resting periods at stop-over sites. The aim of our study was to test whether birds caught during active flight show a higher concentration of migratory activity in the seasonally appropriate migratory direction in the funnels than birds that had not experienced migration just before the funnel experiments. The topography at the alpine pass Col de Bretolet at the border of Switzerland and France allowed us to capture birds during active migratory flight. These birds were in full migration disposition. Orientation experiments with chaffinches suggested an influence of the sun because chaffinches did not orient in the seasonally expected direction, but probably showed positive phototaxis towards the light of the sun at the opposite side of the funnel. Chaffinches tested under overcast conditions oriented to the north-west which probably was a 'nonsense' orientation and not a reverse migration or compensatory behaviour.

Das Institut, das weltweit das erste seiner Art wäre, soll die Grundlagen für eine sich bereits am Horizont abzeichnende allgemeine Wissenschaft der  Evolution schaffen, evolutionstheoretische Ansätze aus mehreren Disziplinen miteinander verbinden und neue fachübergreifende Forschung initiieren. Die Entwicklung eines abstrakten Evolutionsbegriffs, der über die Erhaltung, Variation und Verbreitung von Struktur definiert und so spezifizierbar ist, daß er die Fälle von vorkommenden oder möglichen Typen evolutionärer Prozesse charakterisieren und vergleichen kann, erfordert ein längerfristiges enges Zusammenwirken von theoretischer und empirischer sowie von fachübergreifender und
einzelwissenschaftlicher Forschung. Auf der Basis des transdisziplinären Evolutionsbegriffs sollen evolutionäre Prozesse in Natur, Gesellschaft und Technik im Vergleich und in ihren Wechselwirkungen erforscht und erklärt werden. Dazu müssen solche Prozesse empirisch untersucht, formal modelliert und exemplarisch auf dem Computer simuliert werden. Die angestrebte wissenschaftliche Fundierung eines allgemeinen Evolutionskonzepts wird die heute noch zu wenig reflektierte Uebernahme von evolutionstheoretischen Konzepten aus der Biologie in die Sozial- und Verhaltenswissenschaften ablösen, bei der diese Konzepte viel zu oft zu Metaphern reduziert werden oder sich als schwer anpaßbar erweisen. Das Ergebnis werden allgemeine Erkenntnisse über das Wesen der Entwicklung hochstrukturierter Systeme sein, aber auch neue Methoden und Erkenntnisse in den Einzelwissenschaften, die adäquatere Beschreibungsmodelle für evolutionäre Prozesse benötigen. Eine bedeutende neue Komponente soll die Erforschung von komplexen Entwicklungsvorgängen sein, in denen sehr unterschiedliche evolutionäre Prozesse aus Natur, Gesellschaft und Technik zusammenwirken, für die es heute noch keinen gemeinsamen Beschreibungsrahmen gibt.

The unusual reproductive systemin waterfrogs of the Rana esculentacomplex suggests that this replacement may bedriven by a genetic mechanism: Ranaesculenta, a hybrid between R. ridibundaand R. lessonae, eliminates the lessonae genome from the germline and clonallytransmits the ridibunda genome(hybridogenesis). Hybrids form mixedpopulations with R. lessonae (L-E-system)in which they persist by backcrossing with theparental species. Matings between hybrids areunsuccessful, because their ridibundagenomes contain fixed recessive deleteriousmutations. When introduced into a L-E-system,R. ridibunda can mate with both nativetaxa, producing R. ridibunda offspringwith R. esculenta, and R. esculentaoffspring with R. lessonae (primaryhybridizations). If primary hybrids arehybridogenetic, they produce viable R.ridibunda offspring in matings with otherhybrids, because their clonal genomes areunlikely to share the deleterious allelespresent in the ancient clones. Thus, R.ridibunda will increase in the population atthe expense of both native taxa, eventuallyleaving a pure R. ridibunda population.We provide three lines of evidence for thisprocess from a currently invaded population inSwitzerland: (1) Primary hybridizations takeplace, as roughly 10% of hybrids in thepopulation possess ridibunda genomesderived from the introduced frogs. (2)Hybridogenesis occurs in primary hybrids,although at a low frequency. (3) Many hybrid ×hybrid matings in the population indeed produceviable offspring. Hence, the proposed geneticmechanism appears to contribute to the speciesreplacement, although its importance may belimited.;Faculty of Science: Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies;Faculty of Science;Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies;;561;7375626A656374733D3130313732;3130313237;;0,003715164;0,200083748;0,007240115;0,001627195;0,473621786;0,993331254;0,001947924;0,005256103;0,009780809;0,07555636;0,012126897;0,222464561;0,004387483;0,487590581;0,681996942;0,003561334;0,010160724;en;EuropeSwitzerland;Switzerland

Striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) males in the moist grasslands of South Africa follow a roaming mating strategy, visiting several receptive females, and do not participate in parental care. In contrast, males in the arid succulent karoo are permanent members of social groups and help care for young. We predicted that paternal care leads to fitness benefits in striped mice from the succulent karoo but not from the grasslands. Experiments were conducted simultaneously in both locations under captive seminatural conditions to study offspring growth and survival to weaning in two experimental groups: father absent and father present. In the succulent karoo, offspring development was faster when the father was present, but the father's absence did not affect offspring growth in the grasslands. The significantly lower night temperatures in the succulent karoo compared to the grasslands negatively influenced offspring development during the first 3 days after birth, which in turn influenced offspring development until weaning. Exposure to low temperatures is energetically costly to free-living mice, as indicated by a greater loss of body weight during cold spring nights than warmer summer nights. We suggest that paternal care, particularly huddling of pups, improves offspring development in the succulent karoo, whereas the presence or absence of the father does not appear to directly influence offspring growth in the grasslands.;Faculty of Science: Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies;Faculty of Science;Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies;;572;7375626A656374733D3130313732;3130313237;;0,003639582;0,30955115;0,77817744;0,001497742;0,637641609;0,019958371;0,002563369;0,012574583;0,009081376;0,090086579;0,027026271;0,09037213;0,020672463;0,296283692;0,935966611;0,003017623;0,024137031;en;South Africaroo;South Africa
